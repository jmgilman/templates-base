# Base Template

This repository is one of several repositories that contains a [Copier] template
for use in my various open-source projects. This repository serves as the *base*
template which provides the foundation for a [Nix Development Shell][devshell]
using the [Std] framework.

Noteworthy of this approach is that it allows isolation of development tooling
to the project level and reduces clutter in my workstation.
